# Tree Traversals

Tree traversal refers to the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure exactly once in a systematic way.

## Basic Description

Tree traversals are fundamental algorithms for processing tree structures. They define the order in which nodes are visited and processed. The choice of traversal method depends on the specific requirements of the problem being solved.

## Types of Traversals

### Depth-First Traversals
- **Preorder**: Root → Left → Right
- **Inorder**: Left → Root → Right
- **Postorder**: Left → Right → Root

### Breadth-First Traversal
- **Level Order**: Visit nodes level by level from top to bottom

## Applications

Tree traversals are used in:
- Expression evaluation
- Tree serialization and deserialization
- Finding paths in trees
- Tree copying and cloning
- Syntax analysis in compilers

## Implementation Approaches

Each traversal can be implemented using:
- Recursive approach (more intuitive)
- Iterative approach (using stacks/queues)
