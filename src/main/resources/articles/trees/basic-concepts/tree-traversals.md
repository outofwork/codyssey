# Tree Traversals

Tree traversal refers to the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure exactly once in a systematic way.

## Basic Description

Tree traversals are fundamental algorithms for processing tree structures. They define the order in which nodes are visited and processed, enabling various operations like searching, copying, and expression evaluation.

## Types of Tree Traversals

### Depth-First Traversals

#### Preorder Traversal
Visit order: Root → Left → Right
- Process current node first
- Then traverse left subtree
- Finally traverse right subtree

#### Inorder Traversal  
Visit order: Left → Root → Right
- Traverse left subtree first
- Process current node
- Then traverse right subtree

#### Postorder Traversal
Visit order: Left → Right → Root
- Traverse left subtree first
- Then traverse right subtree
- Process current node last

### Breadth-First Traversal

#### Level Order Traversal
- Visit nodes level by level
- Process all nodes at depth d before nodes at depth d+1
- Uses queue data structure for implementation

## Implementation Approaches

Each traversal can be implemented using:
- **Recursive**: More intuitive, uses call stack
- **Iterative**: Uses explicit stack or queue, more memory efficient

## Applications

Tree traversals are essential for:
- Expression tree evaluation
- Tree serialization and deserialization
- Finding specific nodes or paths
- Tree copying and structural operations
- Syntax analysis in compilers
