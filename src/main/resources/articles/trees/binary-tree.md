# Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Basic Description

Binary trees are fundamental hierarchical data structures that form the basis for many advanced tree structures. Each node in a binary tree contains data and references to at most two child nodes.

## Properties

- Each node has at most two children
- Children are labeled as left and right
- The left child and its descendants form the left subtree
- The right child and its descendants form the right subtree
- Can be empty (null tree)

## Types of Binary Trees

### Full Binary Tree
Every node has either 0 or 2 children (no node has exactly 1 child).

### Complete Binary Tree
All levels are filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.

### Perfect Binary Tree
All internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

### Balanced Binary Tree
The height of the left and right subtrees differ by at most 1 for every node.

## Applications

Binary trees are used in:
- Expression parsing and evaluation
- Hierarchical data representation
- Decision trees in machine learning
- File system organization
- Database indexing structures

## Common Operations

- Insertion of nodes
- Deletion of nodes
- Tree traversals
- Height calculation
- Node counting
