# Linear Data Structures

Linear data structures are data structures where elements are arranged sequentially, where each element is connected to the previous and the next element in a linear fashion.

## Characteristics

- Elements are arranged in a sequential manner
- Each element has a unique predecessor and successor (except for the first and last elements)
- Memory allocation can be sequential or non-sequential
- Examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues

## Types of Linear Data Structures

### 1. Array
A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.

### 2. Linked List
A linear collection of data elements where each element contains a reference to the next element.

### 3. Stack
A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

### 4. Queue
A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

## Applications

Linear data structures are fundamental building blocks used in:
- Algorithm implementation
- System programming
- Database management
- Compiler design
- Operating systems
