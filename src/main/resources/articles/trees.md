# Trees

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. It represents a collection of nodes where each node contains a value and references to its child nodes.

## Characteristics

- Hierarchical structure with a root node
- Each node can have zero or more child nodes
- No cycles exist in the structure
- There's exactly one path between any two nodes
- Has n-1 edges for n nodes

## Basic Terminology

- **Root**: The top node of the tree
- **Parent**: A node that has child nodes
- **Child**: A node that has a parent node
- **Leaf**: A node with no children
- **Height**: The longest path from root to leaf
- **Depth**: The distance from root to a particular node
- **Level**: All nodes at the same depth

## Types of Trees

### 1. Binary Tree
A tree where each node has at most two children.

### 2. Binary Search Tree (BST)
A binary tree with ordered properties for efficient searching.

### 3. Balanced Trees
Trees that maintain balance to ensure optimal performance.

### 4. Specialized Trees
Various tree structures optimized for specific use cases.

## Applications

Trees are used in:
- File systems
- Database indexing
- Expression parsing
- Decision making algorithms
- Network routing protocols
